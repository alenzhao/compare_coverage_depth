A Julia script for comparing the coverage between two choromosones for a set of sequenced samples, for example when trying to determine sex from the number of sequencing reads attributed to the sex chromosomes in each sample.
The input should be in the format generated by genomecov.
Depends on the PyPlot Julia package.

Positional input arguments:
1) File name prefix.  The input sample file names are expected to be of the form "prefix""sampleID""suffix".
2) File name suffix.
3) Path to sample list.  Path to a file listing sample IDs to be processed.
4) Path to output summary table.
5) Comma delimited string of four numbers giving the 2D coordinates of two points on the line used to separate the data into two categories.
6) Path to output file listing the sample IDs and a label determining which group they were assigned to.

Other parameters, such as chromosome names and plot colours can be found at the top of the Julia script file itself.
